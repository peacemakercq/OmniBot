# - any question text can be referenced by syntax: {q:state_name}
# - any answer text can be referenced by syntax: {a:state_name}

# Static Placeholder syntax:

#   NOTE: you can use Runtime placeholder syntax in Static placeholder, but NOT vice versa.
#         That's because the Runtime Placeholders are always populated prior to Static Placeholders
